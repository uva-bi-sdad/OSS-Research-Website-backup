Brandon Kramer (Ph.D., Rutgers University) is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Social and Decision Analytics division at the University of Virginia's Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative. Generally, Brandon’s research interests lie at the intersection of science, technology, and health. In his dissertation research, Brandon incorporated aspects of medical sociology, science & technology studies, and computational social science to study how racial and gendered health disparities are constructed and reproduced in biomedical research. At the Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative, he contributes to projects on open source software development and evidence-based policymaking in Northern Virginia. Brandon obtained his B.A. from the University of Iowa and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Rutgers University.
